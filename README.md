1. Introduction
1.1 The Vision

Elon Musk’s companies are powered by electricity, ambition, and a knack for breaking the internet. Buzzcoin ( $BZZZZ ) distills that energy into a memecoin that’s equal parts satire and celebration.

As the first GTO, this coin hands the reins to the community with AI-assisted flair, ensuring the buzz stays electric.

1.2 The Problem

The crypto space is flooded with dull tokens lacking soul or sound effects. Memecoins like Dogecoin and Fartcoin proved humor drives adoption, but none have tapped into the electric chaos of Elon’s world—until now.

1.3 The Solution

Buzzcoin delivers:
- A token tied to Elon’s ecosystem of innovation.
- A community-driven reward system for Musk-inspired memes.
- A transaction sound (“BZZZZ”) that’s as annoying as it is addictive.
